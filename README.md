# XLSTM

A pure pytorch implementation of the [XLSTM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517).

## Notes
- I just made this after a pass or two of reading the paper so there may be inconsistencies with the paper or mistakes, I will work on fixing these as I notice them and as they are pointed out
- I have not yet looked into any of the efficiencies or parallelization techniques discussed in the paper.

## TODO
- Ensure correct with paper
- Create some usage examples
- Implement paralleization
- CUDA?
